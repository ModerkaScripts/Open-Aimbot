# Notifications Section

**Show Notifications** and **Show Warnings** settings are responsible for displaying pop-up windows.

**Notifications** are small frames that appear in the lower right corner of the screen.

**Warnings** are frames that appear in the center of the aimbot interface in order to convey more important information to you. *Disabling **Show Warnings** will stop displaying only messages sent by the script security system. Be careful with this option if you are using **Acrylic**.*

*The settings of this section are saved automatically if the software supports IO Library.*
