# Advanced Checks Section

If **FoV Check** is enabled, the aimbot will only respond to targets within the **FoV Radius** limit. *This option will reduce the risk of detection, as the aimbot will not respond to players outside your field of vision.*

If **Magnitude Check** is enabled, the aimbot will only respond to targets located at a distance from you to **Trigger Magnitude**. *This option will reduce the risk of detection, as the aimbot will not respond to players who are very far away from you.*

If **Transparency Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to players whose head is more transparent than **Ignored Transparency**. *It is recommended to enable it to reduce the risk of detection.*

If **Group Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to players who are in a group with the **Whitelisted Group** ID. *This option can be useful for games with a crew system, such as Da Hood.*
