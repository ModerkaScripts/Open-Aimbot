# SpinBot Section

**SpinBot** is a cheat that makes your character spin to make it harder for opponents to hit you.

***SpinBot** does not function normally in **RenderStepped Rendering Mode**. Set a different **Rendering Mode** value than **RenderStepped** to solve this problem.*

When **SpinBot** is turned on, the activation key will function.

**Spin Key** can operate in hold mode if **One-Press Mode** is off, and in single-press mode if **One-Press Mode** is on.

**Spin Part** settings allow you to add and remove custom body parts that the spinbot will rotate.
