# UI Section

The aimbot has basic interface settings like **Theme**, **Transparency** and **Minimize Key**. Other settings such as **Tab Width**, **Size**, **Acrylic** are available for activation in **UISettings.ttwizz** file.

*You should be careful with **Acrylic** option, as it can be detected by an in-game anti-cheat. For your safety, you will need to provide additional confirmation of the action to activate this option.*

*Interface settings are saved automatically if the software supports IO Library.*
