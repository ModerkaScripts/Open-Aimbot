# TriggerBot Section

**TriggerBot** is a cheat that allows you to shoot automatically after you hover the cursor over the target.

When **TriggerBot Toggle** is turned on, the activation key will function.

**Trigger Key** can operate in hold mode if **One-Press Mode** is off, and in single-press mode if **One-Press Mode** is on.

When **Smart TriggerBot** is enabled, the triggerbot will not respond to the target if the aiming mode is turned off, if turned off, the triggerbot will respond to any target when the cursor is pointed at it.
