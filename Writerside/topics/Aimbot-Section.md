# Aimbot Section

When **Aimbot Toggle** is turned on, the activation key will function.

**Aim Key** can operate in hold mode if **One-Press Mode** is off, and in single-press mode if **One-Press Mode** is on.

If **Mouse Moving Mode** is enabled, then aiming will be performed by moving the cursor towards the target, if turned off, then camera movements will be used for this purpose. *This option may not be supported by some software.*

If **Off After Kill** is enabled, aiming mode will be disabled after killing the target.

**Aim Part** settings allow you to add and remove custom body parts that the aimbot will respond to. *To reduce the risk of detection, you can use **Random** mode.*
