# Aimbot Section

When **Aimbot Toggle** is turned on, the activation key will function.

**Aim Key** can operate in hold mode if **One-Press Mode** is off, and in single-press mode if **One-Press Mode** is on.

**Silent Aim** is a cheat that allows you to aim and shoot at enemies without actually having to physically point the crosshair at the target. This cheat typically works by automatically directing bullets towards the target's hitbox even if you are not aiming directly at them. *This option may not be supported by some software.*

If **Off After Kill** is enabled, aiming mode will be disabled after killing the target.

**Aim Part** settings allow you to add and remove custom body parts that the aimbot will respond to. *To reduce the risk of detection, you can use **Random** mode.*
