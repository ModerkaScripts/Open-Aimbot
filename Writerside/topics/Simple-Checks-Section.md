# Simple Checks Section

If **Team Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to your teammates.

If **Friend Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to your friends.

If **Wall Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to players who are behind a wall or other obstacle. *It is recommended to enable it to reduce the risk of detection.*

If **Water Check** and **Wall Check** are both enabled, the aimbot will not respond to players who are behind a wall or other obstacle, **including water**.

If **Verified Badge Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to players who have a verified badge. *This option can reduce the risk of manual detection, as players with a verified badge tend to have more privileges in games.*
