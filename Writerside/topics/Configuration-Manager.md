# Configuration Manager

*This section will not be displayed if the software does not support the IO Library.*

**Configuration Manager** allows you to make different configs for completely different games. This will greatly simplify the use of aimbot, since it contains a huge number of options, which it is simply irrational and pointless to configure every time. *Each configuration file indicates the date of its last update, this will really help you find a more recent and secure config for the game.*
