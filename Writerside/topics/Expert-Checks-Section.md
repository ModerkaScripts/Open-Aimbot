# Expert Checks Section

If **Ignored Players Check** is enabled, the aimbot will not respond to players from the corresponding drop-down menu. *As a rule, game administrators are entered into **Ignored Players** to avoid unnecessary detections.*

If **Target Players Check** is enabled, the aimbot will only respond to players from the corresponding drop-down menu. *If the target is in both **Target Players** and **Ignored Players** at the same time, then it will also be ignored by the aimbot.*

*In the drop-down menus, you can select several players at once. If you want to temporarily remove a target from the menu, then it's better to simply deselect it than remove it completely.*
