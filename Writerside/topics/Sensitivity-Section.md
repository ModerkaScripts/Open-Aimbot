# Sensitivity Section

**Sensitivity** allows you to make the movements of the camera or mouse cursor smoother and more pleasant when aiming.

**Noise** activates camera shake when aiming. *This option will reduce the risk of detection, as it will make aiming more realistic. It is recommended to use it with **Camera Aim Mode** and **Sensitivity** turned on.*
