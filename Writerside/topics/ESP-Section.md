# ESP Section

**ESP** is the main visual capable of displaying additional information about targets on a map.

There are several types of **ESP** in the aimbot:
- ***ESP Box***
- ***Name ESP***
  - ***Premium ESP***
- ***Health ESP***
- ***Magnitude ESP***
- ***Tracer ESP***

If **Smart ESP** is enabled, only players who can be targeted by the aimbot will be highlighted on a map. *This option uses the settings of **Simple Checks**, **Advanced Checks**, **Expert Checks** and **Premium Checks** of the aimbot.*
