# Aim Offset Section

*Offset settings can be useful for more accurate aiming with prediction of target's movement direction and in games with a ballistics system where bullets fly at an angle.*

**Static Offset** allows you to aim above the target's head. *This option can be used to fire weapons whose bullets fly at an angle, such as the Grenade Launcher.*

**Dynamic Offset** allows you to aim more properly and exact with prediction of target's movement direction.

**Auto Offset** adjusts the offset depending on the distance between you and the target and on the increments of static and dynamic offset.
